# Real-Time Digital Signage System

> **Abstract** : This project aims to develop a Real-Time Digital Signage System that enables users to upload and display images, text, or videos on a TV screen instantly. The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing content, ensuring seamless updates without manual intervention. Designed for applications such as advertisements, announcements, and information displays, this system is ideal for malls, offices, educational institutions, and public spaces.
